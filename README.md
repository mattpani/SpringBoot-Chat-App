# SpringBoot-Chat-App

Java TCP communication & Spring boot Web Application.

Apache Tomcat server. 

PostgresSQL was used for database.

There is a repo without Spring Boot, with just basic servlets. 

PlautProjekt 

There is even client side with simple Swing Gui with Chat room for all users and cipher & decipher function for text.

Hope someone find this helpful.
